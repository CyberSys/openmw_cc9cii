/* ISDIGIT differs from isdigit, as follows:
   - Its arg may be any int or unsigned int; it need not be an unsigned char.
   - It's guaranteed to evaluate its argument exactly once.
   - It's typically faster.
   POSIX says that only '0' through '9' are digits.  Prefer ISDIGIT to
   ISDIGIT_LOCALE unless it's important to use the locale's definition
   of `digit' even when the host does not conform to POSIX.  */
